## Form Validation

### Adding form validation to employees
- Probably the most common directives you will use will be Angular's form directives.
- Angular has form validation built in.
- Let's take advantage of that and add some form validation to the employees form.
- Open **client/assets/templates/app/employees/form.html**

- We need to tell Angular that we are NOT using HTML5 validation in our form, but will be using Angular's validation. 

- Find the ```<form>``` tag and add the `novalidate` attribute.  

```xml
<form class="form-horizontal" novalidate name="employeeForm">
```

- Add the following validation to the form:
  - Set the **username** to have a minimum length of 1, a max length of 40, and a required field.
  - Set the **email** to have a minimum length of 1, a max length of 100, and a required field.
  - Set the **first name** to have a minimum length of 1, a max length of 100, and a required field.
  - Set the **last name** to have a minimum length of 1, a max length of 100, and a required field.


- We want to make sure the user is not allowed to submit the form unless it is valid.
- In the button tag for the save button add the following directive:

```javascript
ng-disabled="employeeForm.$invalid"
```
- This watches the form with the name, `employeeForm`, to make sure it is valid.
- When it is valid, `employeeForm.$invalid` will resolve to false, so Angular will remove the attribute, `disabled` from the `<button>`.

- Now start the application and see what happens when you make the form valid and invalid.
- Feel free to play with different values for the validation parameters and see the effects.
- Pretty neat, huh?

## Pagination Directive from UI Bootstrap

### UI Bootstrap Pagination

- Our product owners have decided that they only want to see 5 items at a time in our list pages.
- In order to accomodate them, we are going to use the *pagination directive* from the UI Bootstrap project.
- Your teammates have already added the library as an import to `index.html` and added as a dependency in `main.js`.
- The server team has also provided us with the correct API endpoints to retrieve paginated data.

- The first task we need to complete is to make sure that we can query the API for paginated data.
  - We will implement the employee list screen first.

### Pagination for Employees

> Once again the projects module has been completed for you so that you can use it as a frame of reference.

###### Modify the controller method for getting a list of employees
- Your teammates have implemented the controller changes needed to get a page of employees for you.
- Open **client/src/app/employees/controllers.js**

- Review the `requestEmployees()` method on scope:
  - The pagination api expects a query object with a page number and sort properties.
    - `page` : the value of the `page` parameter
    - `sort` : a Javascript object that has a `username` property with the value of 1.

```javascript
var query = {
  page: page,
  sort: {username: 1}
};
```

&nbsp;
> Our pagination service endpoint returns a JSON object that contains all of the configuration needed for pagination.
> It also contains a data property which is an array of our resources.

&nbsp;
- Our team replaced the `data.list` function call with the `data.page` function.
  - This uses the `query` object we just created as a the options object.
  - It also sets the response to `pageConfig` on our controller's scope.

```javascript
data.page('employees', query)
  .then(function (pageConfig) {
    vm.pageConfig = pageConfig;
  });
```

###### Test the api call
- Now run the tests, using `grunt karma:unit` in a separate console from your `server` and `watch` tasks.
- Did they all pass?
- Open the **controllers.spec.js** file to check how your team tested the new controller functionality.

###### Add the pagination directive to the employees list page

- Now that we have the function in place to request the page of employees, we can add the directive to the list page to control when and how the page requests are made.
- Open **client/assets/templates/app/employees/index.html**
- Look for the `TODO` near line 51 and add the *pagination* directive:
  - Set the `total-items` to the value of `employeeCtrl.pageConfig.totalItems`.
  - Set the `page` to the value of `employeeCtrl.pageConfig.page`.
  - Set the `items-per-page` to the value of `employeeCtrl.pageConfig.limit`
  - We also want to show the `boundary-links` and have the buttons `rotate`.
  - Lastly, when a page is selected, we want to call the `requestEmployees(page)` function on our controller's scope.

```xml
<div class="text-center">
  <div pagination
    total-items="employeeCtrl.pageConfig.totalItems"
    page="employeeCtrl.pageConfig.page"
    items-per-page="employeeCtrl.pageConfig.limit"
    boundary-links="true"
    rotate="true"
    on-select-page="employeeCtrl.requestEmployees(page)">
  </div>
</div>
```

- UI Bootstrap's pagination directive expects a number of attributes to control how it works.
  - `total-items` : The total number of items available in the database.
    - This helps the directive figure out how many buttons to display for pages.
  - `page` : The page number currently displayed
  - `items-per-page` : How many items are displayed per page.
    - Also used to determine how many page buttons there will be.
  - `boundary-links` : Whether or not to show the rewind and fast forward buttons.
  - `rotate` : Whether or not to keep the current page's button in the middle.
  - `on-select-page` : What happens when the user clicks one of the page buttons.
    - This automatically calls the function with the page number as the argument.

- With this directive added, navigate to the employees page and check to see if it is displayed.
- If you don't have over 5 employees added to the database, try adding several and watch what happens to the pagination directive.

&nbsp;
### Pagination for Timesheets

- Now that we have pagination for the employees page, use the above instructions as a guide and add pagination to timesheets.

###### Modify the controller to request a page of projects

- Our team has implemented the controller functionality for you.
- Review **client/src/app/timesheets/controllers.js**.
- Do you see any differences?

###### Add the directive to the timesheets list page

- Find the `TODO` in **client/assets/templates/app/timesheets/index.html** near line #49.

```xml
<div class="text-center">
  <div pagination
    total-items="timesheetCtrl.pageConfig.totalItems"
    page="timesheetCtrl.pageConfig.page"
    items-per-page="timesheetCtrl.pageConfig.limit"
    boundary-links="true"
    rotate="true"
    on-select-page="timesheetCtrl.requestTimesheets(page)">
  </div>
</div>
```

###### Run the application
- Time to verify that you have pagination for Timesheets.
- If it works, time to move on to the next section!


## Create a Section Header directive

###### The situation
- Now that you are an expert at using provided directives, it's time to create our own!!
- Our product owners have returned with more requests. They would like to have certain sections to have a consistent header that could also include other elements.
- To satisfy these requirements, the team has decided that a custom directive is needed so that it can be reused across multiple views.

###### Register the new directive

- Open **client/src/directives/form.js** and find the `TODO` near line #3.
- Register a `tszFormSectionHeader` directive that:
  - Replaces the DOM element that uses the directive.
  - Creates an isolate scope that expects a `header` attribute that will be assigned to the `header` property on scope.
  - Uses transclusion so that it can wrap other DOM elements like a picture frame.
  - Uses the template located at : `assets/templates/directives/form/form-header.html`


```javascript
.directive('tszFormSectionHeader', function () {
  return {
    replace: true,
    transclude: true,
    scope: {
      header: '@'
    },
    templateUrl: 'assets/templates/directives/form/form-header.html'
  };
})
```
###### Create the template

- Open **client/assets/templates/directives/form/form-header.html**
- Add the following markup to the template:

```xml
<div class="row tsz-form-section-header">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
    <h4>{{header}}</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6">
    <div ng-transclude></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- What does this template do?
  - Creates an evenly spaced 2 column row.
  - Binds to `scope.header` in the first column.
  - Inserts any DOM that the element wraps into the second column. (via `ng-transclude` directive)

###### Test the directive

- Now let's test the new directive to show that it is behaving as expected.
- Directive unit tests take a little more setup than any other tests, because they are so dependent on the DOM and need to be compiled and linked by Angular.
- Open **client/test/unit/directives/form.spec.js**
- Find the `TODO` near line #13 and register the directive's template as a dependency:

```javascript
'assets/templates/directives/form/form-header.html',
```
- Since we registered the `karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor` plugin in our *karma.config.js*, we are able to register the template as a dependency and have it added to the `$templateCache` service so that we can use it in our tests.

- Find the `TODO` near line #30 and set up the test fixture.
  - Using `angular.element()`, create a DOM element that calls the directive.
  - Use the `$compile` service to get a compile function from the created element and call the compile function passing in your test scope.
  - Have Angular run a digest and apply so that the compiled template is ready for testing.

```javascript
element = angular.element(
 '<div tsz-form-section-header header="{{headerName}}">' +
 '   <p>{{content}}</p>' +
 '</div>');

$compile(element)($scope);

$scope.$digest();
$scope.$apply();
```

###### What is really happening here?
  - Since we are not completely bootstrapping our entire Angular application in our unit tests, we need to simulate the bootstrapping process.
  - We register a DOM element with the `angular` global object.
  - We then tell the $compile service to process the registered element.
  - Angular gives us a linking function as a result which we immediately call with our test `$scope`.
  - After our element has been compiled and linked, we tell Angular to run its digest cycle and apply it to our test '$scope'.
  - Once that is complete, we have a small section of DOM that is fully 'Angular-aware' and can be tested.  

###### Test the header is set
- Look for the `TODO` near line #42.
- Add the below test to check that the directive adds a `<h4>` tag.

```javascript
it('should set the header content within the directive template', function () {
  expect(element.find('h4').text()).to.equal('My Header');
});
```

###### Test the directive responds to changes on the model
- Directly below, add this test that changes the `headerName` on scope and checks the result.

```javascript
it('should respond to changes', function () {
  expect(element.find('h4').text()).to.equal('My Header');
  $scope.$apply(function() {
    $scope.headerName = 'My Updated Header';
  });
  expect(element.find('h4').text()).to.equal('My Updated Header');
});
```
> Something new!! We called $scope.$apply() in this test. This tells Angular that
> an event happened outside of its normal run loop so that it knows to run a new digest cycle
> and apply any changes that would result.

- Run `grunt karma:unit` and verify that these both pass.

###### Test the transclusion

- Now we want to verify that any DOM elements that we wrap with our directive appear in the second column.
- Find the `TODO` near line #55 and add this test.

```javascript
it('should transclude the directive element contents', function () {
  expect(element.find('p').text()).to.equal('My Content');
});
```
- Now run all of the tests and verify that we are 'all green'.

###### See the directive at work

- Let's add some headers to our Timesheet and Timeunits forms.

- Open **client/assets/templates/app/timesheets/detail.html**
- Find the `TODO` near line #7 and add the following:

```xml
<div tsz-form-section-header header="Timesheet Details"></div>
```

- Next, look for the `TODO` near line #65 and add a wrapped version:

```xml
<div tsz-form-section-header header="Time Units">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-8 pull-right">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block" ng-click="timesheetDetailCtrl.logTime()">Log Time</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
- Now you can refresh the page, navigate to a Timsheet detail and see your work.
- Do you see your new headers? Is the `Log Time` Button displayed in the same row as the `Time Units` header?

&nbsp;
## Create a Timesheet Progress Indicator

###### The Situation
- Our wonderful product owners have now decided that we need a visual representation of the percentage of completion for each timecard.
- After some research, we discover *Bootstrap* provides us with a *progress bar* widget, but we need a way to dynamically provide it with data.
- We decide this is a perfect case to write our own directive!

###### Write the directive

- Open **client/src/directives/timesheet.js**
- Notice that your teammates have already created the module for you. Aren't they awesome?
- Our directive's requirements are:
  - The directive will replace the DOM elements that call it.
  - We need an isolate scope with the following properties.
    - `hoursWorked` : Needs to be bound to the expression in the `hours-worked` attribute.
    - `hoursRequired` : Needs to be bound to the expression in the `hours-required` attribute.
    - `report` : Needs to be bound to the evaluation of the `report` attribute, so that we can call it like a callback.
  - It will use a template, `progress-bar.html`.
  - We need to watch for changes to `hoursWorked` and `hoursRequired` so that a new percentage calculation can be performed.
  - It also needs a function on scope to handle a click event and call our callback, `report`.


- Find the `TODO` near line #3 and register your `tszWeeklyProgressBar` directive.

```javascript
.directive('tszWeeklyProgressBar', function () {
  return {
    replace: true,
    scope: {
      hoursRequired: '=',
      hoursWorked: '=',
      report: '&'
    },
    templateUrl: 'assets/templates/directives/timesheet/progress-bar.html',
    link: function (scope, element) {
      scope.$watch(function() {
        return (scope.hoursWorked / scope.hoursRequired) * 100;
      }, function(percentComplete) {
        scope.percentComplete = percentComplete;
      });
      scope.progressClicked = function progressClicked() {
        scope.report({percentComplete: Math.round(scope.percentComplete) + "%"});
      };
    }
  };
});
```

> Something new!! We used Angular's $scope.$watch() function that takes 2 functions as arguments.
> Angular will do dirty checking against the result of the first function and call the second
> function if the value has changed since the last digest cycle.

- Now, let's add our template
- Open **client/assets/templates/directives/timesheet/progress-bar.html**
- Add the following markup:


```xml
<div class="progress" ng-click="progressClicked()">
  <div class="progress-bar" style="width: {{percentComplete > 100 ? 100 : percentComplete}}%;">
    {{percentComplete | number:0}}%
  </div>
</div>
```

- Did you notice?
  - We registered a click handler and bound `progressClicked()` from our isolate scope.
  - We also bound `percentComplete` from scope to the width and display text.
    - Remember `percentComplete` is a calculation that happens if either `hoursWorked` or `hoursRequired` changes on scope.

###### Test the directive

- Now that we have the directive, let's make sure it behaves as expected.
- Open **client/test/unit/directives/timesheet.spec.js**
- Look for the `TODO` near line #11 and register the dependencies for our Jasmine spec:

```javascript
'timesheet.directives',
'ngResource',
'assets/templates/directives/timesheet/progress-bar.html'
```

- Before each test runs, we need to build up a DOM element that calls the directive and provides it with the attributes that it needs.
- Find the `TODO` near line #24 and complete the `beforeEach`:

```javascript
beforeEach(function () {
  $scope.hoursWorked = 40;
  $scope.hoursRequired = 100;

  element = angular.element(
    '<div tsz-weekly-progress-bar' +
    '  hours-worked="hoursWorked"'  +
    '  hours-required="hoursRequired"' +
    '  report="reportStatus(percentComplete)">' +
    '</div>');

  $compile(element)($scope);

  $scope.$digest();
  $scope.$apply();
});
```

- First we need to test how it behaves if progress is less than 100%

```javascript
describe('progress bar <= 100%', function() {
  it('should set the progress bar width to the percent complete', function () {
    expect(element.find('.progress-bar').css('width')).to.equal('40%');
  });

  it('should set the progress bar contents to the percent complete', function () {
    expect(element.find('.progress-bar').text().trim()).to.equal('40%');
  });
});
```
- What happens if progress is over 100% ?

```javascript
describe('progress bar > 100%', function() {
  beforeEach(function() {
    $scope.$apply(function() {
      $scope.hoursWorked = 80;
      $scope.hoursRequired = 40;
    });
  });

  it('should set the progress bar width to 100% complete', function () {
    expect(element.find('.progress-bar').css('width')).to.equal('100%');
  });

  it('should set the progress bar contents to the percent complete', function () {
    expect(element.find('.progress-bar').text().trim()).to.equal('200%');
  });
});
```
- Notice in the `beforeEach` of the above tests we are calling `$scope.$apply`
  - This forces Angular to process the changes on scope.
  - Which will, in turn, set those properties on scope and fire our `$watch` function.
  - Which will create a new calculation for `percentComplete`
  - Which is used by our template to set the width of the progress bar.
  - Got it?

###### Let's use it in our view

- It's finally time to see our directive at work!
- Open **client/assets/templates/app/timesheets/detail.html**

- Let's first add a header so that our users know what they are seeing.
- Look for the `TODO` near line #39 and add:

```xml
<div tsz-form-section-header header="Timesheet Progress"></div>
```

- Now let's add the directive.
- Find the `TODO` near line #41 and put in our markup to call the directive.

```xml
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <div tsz-weekly-progress-bar hours-worked="timesheetDetailCtrl.hoursWorked()"
      hours-required="timesheetDetailCtrl.hoursRequired()" report="timesheetDetailCtrl.reportStatus(percentComplete)"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
- You probably noticed that your teammates have already implemented the `hoursWorked()` and `hoursRequired()` functions for you in the controller.
- To see what these functions do, open the `controllers.js` in src/app/timesheets and check it out.

- Now you're ready to refresh the page, navigate to the timesheet view, and see your handywork in action!!
- Try deleting/restoring timeunits and see what happens!! Only dynamic awesomeness!! No big deal!!
