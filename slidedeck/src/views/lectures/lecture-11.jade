    h1 E2E Testing

  section
    h2 What is E2E?

  section
    p E2E stands for End-to-End

  section
    p E2E testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish.

  section
    p E2E tests validate the functionality of the application as a whole instead of the individual parts and pieces (unit testing).

  section
    p Typically, E2E testing in web applications is the automation of an end user.

  section
    p The preferred tool used to accomplish this testing in AngularJS applications is Protractor.

  section
    h1 Protractor

  section
    p What is Protractor?

  section
    p Protractor is an end to end test framework for AngularJS applications thats built on top of WebDriverJS.

  section
    p WebDriverJS is just a JavaScript API for Selenium.

  section
    p What is Selenium?

  section
    p Selenium is a tool that automates browsers and it runs as an independent server.

  section
    p Think of Selinium as an end user.

  section
    p We use WebDriverJS to send instructions to a Selenium server running in the background.

  section
    h2 ChromeDriver
    p In this lab we're going to use ChromeDriver which allows us to bypass a Selenium installation and "drive" Chrome directly.

  section
    h1 Writing E2E Tests

  section
    p Protractor and WebDriverJS expose global API's that you can use to automate actions that a user would perform.

  section
    p
      code browser
      |   is a wrapper around an instance of webdriver.
    p You can use this for navigation and page-wide information.

  section
    p
      code element
      |   is a helper function for finding and interacting with elements on the page you are testing.

  section
    p
      code by
      |   is a collection of element locator strategies.
    p For example, elements can be found by CSS selector, by ID, or by the attribute they are bound to with ng-model.

  section
    p These locator strategies are Angular aware.
    p You can use them to find and interact with elements
    ul
      li by.repeater
      li by.model
      li by.binding

  section
    p
      code protractor
      |   is the protractor namespace which wraps the webdriver namespace.
    p This contains static variables and classes, such as protractor.Key which enumerates the codes for special keyboard signals.

  section
    p We can use these functions to automate the end user and test that the page behaves in the way we expect.
    br
    pre.
      <code data-trim>
      describe('Employees', function () {

        beforeEach (function () {
          browser.get('#/app/employees');
        });

        describe("clicking new employee", function () {
          it('takes us to the create employee form', function () {
            element(by.buttonText("New Employee")).click();
            expect(element(by.binding('$state.current.data.section')).getText()).toBe("Create Employee");
          });
        });

      });

  section
    h2 Page Objects

  section
    p When writing real tests scripts for your page, it's best to use the Page Objects pattern to make your tests more readable.

  section
    h2 Page Objects

  section
    p What are page objects?
    br
    ul
      li Page Objects are models of the UI you are testing.
      li They reduce the amount of duplications in our tests required to interact with the user interface.
      li Page Objects face in both directions.  You can use them to set or get things like field values.

  section
    p Facing towards the developer of a test, they represent the services offered by a particular page.

  section
    p Facing away from the developer, they should be the only thing that has a deep knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a page (or part of a page)

  section
    p It's simplest to think of the methods on a Page Object as offering the "services" that a page offers rather than exposing the details and mechanics of the page.

  section
    p Here we're creating a page object that models part of the employees list page.
    br
    pre.
      <code data-trim>
      function EmployeesIndexPage() {
        this.get = function () {
          browser.get('#/app/employees');
        };

        this.newEmployeeButton = element(
          by.buttonText("New Employee")
        );

        // Here, we're finding an element by it's repeater configuration
        this.firstEmployee = element(
          by.repeater('employee in pageConfig.data').row(0)
        );
      }

      module.exports = new EmployeesIndexPage();

      </code>

  section
    p To start using a page object, just require it.
    br
    pre.
      <code data-trim>
      describe('Employees', function () {

        var indexPage = require('./index.page.js');

      });

      </code>

  section
    p Then, we'll use a beforeEach to make sure that each of our specs start at the employee index page.
    br
    pre.
      <code data-trim>
      describe('Employees', function () {

        var indexPage = require('./index.page.js');

        beforeEach (function () {
          indexPage.get();
        });

      });

      </code>

  section
    p Finally, we'll use the page object to perform actions and expect results.
    br
    pre.
      <code data-trim>
      describe('Employees', function () {

        var indexPage = require('./index.page.js');

        beforeEach (function () {
          indexPage.get();
        });

        describe("clicking new employee", function () {
          it('takes us to the create employee form', function () {
            indexPage.clickNewEmployee();
            expect(formPage.getPageTitle()).toBe("Create Employee");
          });
        });

      });

      </code>

  section
    p Yes, it's that easy

  section
    h3 Things to consider

  section
    p Write tests that address the behavior of your application and not the framework (don’t test data binding).

  section
    p Each test block should test as little as possible.

  section
    h1 Lab Eleven
    h2 Protractor

  section
    p In this lab, you'll set up protractor and create some E2E tests.
