            JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which comes with great power of expression,
            but it also comes with almost no help from the compiler.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>For this reason any code written in JavaScript needs to come with a strong set of tests.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The Angular team has built many features into Angular which makes testing your applications easy.</p>

        <section>

          <ul>
            <li>Essentially a tool that spawns a web server to ..</li>

        <section>
          <p>
            The results for each test against each browser are examined and displayed via the command line
            to the developer such that they can see which browsers and tests passed or failed.

          <h2>Suites</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>A test suite begins with a call to the global Jasmine function<strong> describe()</strong>with two parameters: a string and a function.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            The string is a name or title for a spec suite – usually what is being tested and function is a block of code
            that implements the suite.
          </p>

        <section>
          <p>It is chained with a Matcher function, which takes the expected value.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Each matcher implements a boolean comparison between the actual value and the expected value.</p>

          <h1>Angular Mocks</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Instead of our tests talking to real services, it will often suffice to speak to the 'mock' versions
            of the services, which will respond to calls accurately, but rather unintelligently.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            We use mocks because if we relied on a real service writing real data, then it may interfere with the
            execution of our test runner in its own potentially sandboxed environment.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Let us use the $location service as an example.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            If one of of our tests changes the location of the address bar during testing, this could potentially disrupt
            the entire test process.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Angular provides tools and services to mock different kinds of components when testing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Lets start by mocking a module that we'll be testing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Angular provides angular.mock.module (aliased as 'module' on window) to mock Angular modules</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
beforeEach(module(
  'app.controllers'
));

</code>
</pre>
          <p>Why do we mock the app.controllers module inside a beforeEach statement?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We want to make sure that we're starting with a blank slate so that changes made by other tests don't interfere with the current test.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Now that we've mocked the module that contains the component we wish to test, we need to mock the component itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>More than likely, our component will have dependencies that are required to test it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We use the angular.mock.inject (aliased as 'inject' on window) to inject mock dependencies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
var controller, scope;

beforeEach(module(
  'app.controllers'
));

beforeEach(
  inject(
    function($rootScope, $controller) {
      scope = $rootScope.$new();
      controller = $controller("MainCtrl", {
        $scope: scope
      });
    }
  )
);

</code>
</pre>
          <p>Notice that we use an additional beforeEach here to make sure each test has a fresh controller.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Lets break this down and discuss what's going on in each step.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>To instantiate our controller for testing, we'll need to inject the $controller service and $rootScope service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The inject function is going to inject $rootScope and the $controller services that we need to build an instance of our controller.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
  inject(
    function($rootScope, $controller) {
    
    }

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Now, we're going to create a new scope from the root scope that we'll supply to our controller.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
inject(
  function($rootScope, $controller) {
    scope = $rootScope.$new();
  }
);

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Then, we'll use the $controller service to instantiate our controller and supply the dependencies it needs.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {

});

</code></pre>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
inject(
  function($rootScope, $controller) {
    scope = $rootScope.$new();
    controller = $controller("MainCtrl", {
      $scope: scope
    });
  }
)

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>If we needed to supply additional mock dependencies, we could do that here as well.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, person) {
  $scope.person = person;
});

</code></pre>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
inject(
  function($rootScope, $controller) {
    scope = $rootScope.$new();
    controller = $controller("MainCtrl", {
      $scope: scope
      person: [{id: 1, name:'Cyril'}]
    });
