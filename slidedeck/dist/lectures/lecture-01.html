          <h1>NPM</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>NPM is the official package manager for Node.js</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>NPM runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>It also allows users to install Node.js applications that are available on the npm registry.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>For those who are familiar with dependency management tools and artifact repositories like Maven and Maven Central, NPM is similar.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>One distinct difference between the two is that NPM does not manage build processes like Maven does.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Most, if not all, node projects contain a package.json file in the root project.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>This file exposes metadata about your application as well as it's dependencies.</p>

          <p>When checking out a fresh project from GitHub, simply run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies required to run the project.</p>

          <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
          <p>Contrary to the belief of many, "npm" is not in fact an abbreviation for "Node Package Manager." It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is not an acronym."</p>

        <section>
          <h1>Bower</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Bower is a package manager for front end dependencies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We'll be using Bower in our project to manage libraries that we use in our Angular application, such as Angular itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Like NPM, bower requires a bower.json file in the root of the project that specifies metadata about our project as well as its dependencies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>When checking out a fresh project from GitHub, simply run 'bower install' to install all the client side dependencies required by the client application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Aside from using NPM and Bower to install our dependencies, we wont focus much on NPM or Bower in this training class.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>You can visit the NPM and Bower websites to learn more about them.</p>

          <h1>Grunt</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Grunt is a JavaScript Task Runner.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We'll be using Grunt to automate many of the project build tasks associated with a web application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            The less work we have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit
            testing, linting, and etc, the easier our life becomes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Grunt, by itself, is a framework designed for running tasks.  It also provides a lot of common
            utilities needed for performing things like filesystem operations.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            We'll be using Grunt plugins created by individuals and the community that help automate tasks that are
            specific to our application.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We'll go into more detail about Grunt and how to use it to automate our development process in the last lecture of this training class.</p>

          <p>In this training class, you'll be building a Angular application that tracks employee timesheets across different projects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>To help speed things along so we can focus on the really important parts like Angular, we've created the base project structure for you.</p>
