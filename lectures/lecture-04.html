        <section>
          <p>A module consists of configuration and run blocks which get applied to the application during the bootstrap process.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>In its simplest form, the module consists of two kinds of blocks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Configuration Blocks</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Configuration blocks get executed during the provider registrations and configuration phase.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Only providers and constants can be injected into configuration blocks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>This is to prevent accidental instantiation of services before they have been fully configured.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Run Blocks</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Run blocks get executed after the injector is created and are used to kickstart the application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>This is to prevent further system configuration during application run time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>A run block is the code needed to kickstart the application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>It is executed after all of the services have been configured and the injector has been created.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method.</p>

          <h1>Application Routing</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Everyone is familiar with typical web page development.  When you click a link, it takes you to a new page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>When building single page applications, like ours, this presents a problem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The process of reloading a page adds significant overhead especially considering we already have everything we need to display every page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>This is where the Angular $route service comes into play.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The $route service is used for deep-linking URLs to controllers and views (HTML partials).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>It watches $location.url() and tries to map the path to an existing route definition.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>When the location changes, the $route service will load the HTML partial for the page and then compile and link the associated controller to it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We use the $routeProvider in our module's configuration block to instruct the $route service which URL's are to be matched to which templates and controllers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Lets configure some routes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>This configures the $route service so that when the browser URL is /projects, load the template, compile it, and link the project controller on it.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
angular.module('app', [])
  .config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
      .when('/projects', {
         templateUrl: 'assets/templates/app/projects/index.html',
         controller: 'ProjectCtrl'
      });
  });
  
</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We can add additional configurations by chaining 'when' statements.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
angular.module('app', [])
  .config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
      .when('/projects', {
         templateUrl: 'assets/templates/app/projects/index.html',
         controller: 'ProjectCtrl'
      })
      .when('/employees', {
         templateUrl: 'assets/templates/app/employees/index.html',
         controller: 'EmployeeCtrl'
      });
  });
  
</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>What about when a user enters a URL that's not in the configuration?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Simply add an 'otherwise' statement to the configuration chain to redirect the user to a default page.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
angular.module('app', [])
  .config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
      .when('/projects', {
         templateUrl: 'assets/templates/app/projects/index.html',
         controller: 'ProjectCtrl'
      })
      .otherwise({
         redirectTo: '/projects'
      });
  });
  
</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Now that we've configured the $route service, we need to tell it where to display the matched templates in the DOM.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>For this, we'll use the ngView directive.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="html" data-trim>
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt
&lt;/body&gt;

          <h1>Resources</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>A resource is an abstract term for the data returned by some RESTful endpoint.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Since REST has an established pattern, we can use that pattern to simplify how we send and receive data with our RESTful API.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Angular provides the $resource service to help us with that.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The $resource service is a factory to create a resource object that lets you interact with RESTful server-side data sources.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without the need to interact with the low level $http service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>By default, the $resource class object is configured with the following methods.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
{
  'get':    {method:'GET'},
  'save':   {method:'POST'},
  'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
  'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
  'delete': {method:'DELETE'}
}

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Calling these methods invoke an $http request with the specified http method, destination and parameters.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>When the data is returned from the server, the object is then an instance of the resource class.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The actions save, remove and delete are available on the resource instance as methods with the $ prefix.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Let's create a resource.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
angular.module('app', [])
  .controller(function($resource) {
    var Employee = $resource(
      '/employees/:employeeId',
      {employeeId:'@id'}
    );
  });
  
</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The first argument specifies the URL of the resource.  You can use parameters to substitute variables in those URL's.</p><br>
          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
var Employee = $resource('/employees/:employeeId');

</code>
</pre>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The second argument specifies how $resource should substitute those URL variables with the options passed in.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
var Employee = $resource(
  '/employees/:employeeId',
  {employeeId:'@id'}
);

</code></pre>
          <p>Here, the 'id' property in the options object will be substituted in the place of :employeeId in the resource URL.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>It's important to note here that Employee is a resource class.  We will use the resource class to create new instances of the resource.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Now that we've defined our resource, we can use the Employee resource class to get an instance of an employee</p><br>
          <div class="text-center">
            <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
$scope.employee = Employee.get({id: 23});

</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>What will the HTTP request look like for this action?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>GET /employees/23</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an empty reference.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Once the data is returned from the server the existing reference is populated with the actual data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We can supply a callback function to be executed once the reference is populated with data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>One we have a populated instance of the employee resource, we can change its data and call actions on it.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
$scope.employee = Employee.get({id: 23}, function() {
  $scope.employee.name = 'Lana';
  $scope.employee.$save();
});

</code></pre>
          <p>What will the HTTP request look like for $scope.employee.$save()?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>POST /employees/23</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            In Lab 4, we've wrapped the $resource service with an api and data service to even further simplify how
            you will communicate with the API.
          </p>

          <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
          <h2>Continued</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            During unit testing, we want our unit tests to run quickly and have no external dependencies so we don’t want
            to send network requests to a real server.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>All we really need is to verify whether a certain request has been sent or not.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Or alternatively just let the application make requests, respond with pre-trained responses, and assert that the end result is what we expect it to be.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>To help with this, Angular provides the $httpBackend mock service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The $httpBackend mock service is a fake HTTP backend implementation suitable for unit testing applications that use the $http service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>There are two ways to specify what test data should be returned as http responses by the mock backend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>$httpBackend.expect</strong> - specifies a request expectation</li>
            <li>
              <strong>$httpBackend.when</strong> - specifies a backend definition
              
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <p>Request expectations provide a way to make assertions about requests made by the application and define responses for those requests.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The test will fail if the expected requests are not made or they're made in the wrong order.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Backend definitions</h3>
          <p>Backend definitions allow you to define a fake backend for your application that will not assert a specified request was made. It ONLY returns the configured response.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The test will pass whether or not the request gets made during testing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The $httpBackend used in production always responds to requests asynchronously.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p> If we preserved this behavior in unit testing, we'd have to create asynchronous unit tests.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Asynchronous unit tests are hard to write, follow, and maintain.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The mock can't respond synchronously either, that would change the execution of the code being tested.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>For this reason, the mock $httpBackend service has a flush method.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>The flush method allows you to explicitly flush pending requests.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Lets write a test that uses the mock $httpBackend service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>For brevity, the test setup has been omitted.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
describe('a controller that uses $http', function() {
  it('should be able to make a network request', function () {
    $httpBackend.expect('GET', '/users');
    scope.getUsers();
    $httpBackend.flush();
  });
});

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>We can also specify responses for our mock network requests.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
describe('a controller that uses $http', function() {
  it('should be able to handle errors', function () {
    $httpBackend.expect('GET', '/users').respond(500);
    scope.getUsers();
    $httpBackend.flush();
    // expectations for handling errors
  });
});

</code>
</pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Last, we can provide mock responses to our network requests.</p><br>
          <pre><code class="js" data-trim>
describe('a controller that uses $http', function() {
  it('should put the users on scope', function () {
    $httpBackend.expect('GET', '/users').respond(200, [{id:5}]);
    scope.getUsers();
    $httpBackend.flush();
    expect(scope.users[0].id).to.equal(5);
